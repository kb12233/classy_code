# ClassyCode

ClassyCode is a powerful and intuitive application designed to streamline the process of converting class diagram images into executable code. Built using Flutter, Firebase, and the Gemini API, ClassyCode leverages cutting-edge technology to make code generation from UML diagrams seamless and efficient.

## Features

- **Class Diagram to Code Conversion**: Upload a class diagram image, and ClassyCode generates the corresponding code in seconds.
- **Comprehensive Code Generation**: Handles various relationships and classifiers within class diagrams.
- **Simple and Complex Diagram Support**: Optimized for both simple diagrams with up to 6 classes and complex diagrams with nested relationships.
- **Cloud Integration**: Utilizes Firebase for secure storage and management of user data.
- **Real-Time API Interaction**: Ensures quick response times and high accuracy through the Gemini API.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Developed using Flutter, ClassyCode works seamlessly on Windows and other supported platforms.

## Tech Stack

ClassyCode is built using the following technologies:

- **Flutter**: For cross-platform app development.
- **Firebase**: For secure storage and backend services.
- **Gemini API**: For class diagram verification and code generation.
- **Dart**: The programming language used with Flutter.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 11 or later
- **Hardware Requirements**:
    - Minimum 4 GB RAM
    - Minimum 2 GHz Dual-Core Processor
    - Stable Internet Connection

## Installation

1. **Download the Installer**: Access the latest ClassyCode installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/kb12233/classy_code/releases).
2. **Run the Installer**: Execute the `.exe` file and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. **Launch the Application**: Start the app after installation is complete.

> **Note**: Ensure you run the application as an administrator to enable full functionality with the Gemini API.

## Usage

1. **Login or Register**:
    
    - On launching the app, users are prompted to log in or register.
    - For new users, click the `Register` button, fill in the required details, and create an account.
    - Existing users can log in using their email and password.
2. **Upload a Class Diagram**:
    
    - Click the `Upload` button and select an image of your class diagram.
    - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG.
3. **Verify the Diagram**:
    
    - ClassyCode will use the Gemini API to verify the uploaded image.
4. **Generate Code**:
    
    - Press the `Generate` button to initiate the code generation process.
    - View the generated code directly within the app or save it to your preferred location.
5. **Analyze Relationships**:
    
    - Access additional insights, such as the number of classifiers and relationships detected in the diagram.

## Performance Testing

### API Interaction

ClassyCode's performance was evaluated using Flutter DevTools' network view:

- **Request Metrics**:
    - Request duration
    - HTTP status codes
- **Scenarios**:
    - Image verification
    - Code generation
    - Relationship analysis

### Test Variables

- Request duration
- Success rate (HTTP status codes)

### Test Results

- **Simple Diagrams**: Diagrams with ≤6 classes and 1–2 attributes demonstrated fast request times and high success rates.
- **Complex Diagrams**: Diagrams with >6 classes and nested relationships exhibited slightly increased processing times but maintained high accuracy.

## Usability Testing

Usability was evaluated using the System Usability Scale (SUS) framework, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Limitations

- **Admin Privileges**: The Gemini API requires the app to run with administrator permissions.
- **Diagram Quality**: Low-quality images may result in inaccurate code generation.
- **Generated Outputs**: The code and insights generated by the application may sometimes be inaccurate, depending on the complexity and clarity of the input diagram.
